# VRV Security Backend Developer Intern Assignment

## **Introduction**

This project demonstrates an implementation of **Authentication**, **Authorization**, and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, which are critical concepts in securing modern web applications. The system includes secure user registration, login, and role management, ensuring that users can only access resources that are authorized to them based on their roles.

### **Objective**
- To create a secure system for user authentication and authorization using **JWT tokens**.
- Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** where users are assigned roles (e.g., Admin, User, Moderator) and can access resources based on these roles.

---

## **Core Features**

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration of users.
- **Authorization with Roles**: Role-based access control, where roles such as Admin, User, and Moderator have specific permissions.
- **JWT Authentication**: Using **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for user session management.
- **RBAC System**: Access to resources is restricted based on the user’s role.

## **Project Structure**

The project is structured as follows:

src/
controllers/
middlewares/
models/
routes/
services/
public/
config/
.gitignore
README.md
package.json
markdown
Copy code

### **Key Directories:**
- `controllers/`: Contains logic for user-related actions such as login, registration, and profile management.
- `middlewares/`: Handles middleware logic, such as authentication checks.
- `models/`: Database models for users, roles, and permissions.
- `routes/`: API routes for user management and resource access.
- `services/`: Contains business logic related to authentication and authorization.
- `config/`: Configuration files, including JWT secrets and database connection settings.

## **Installation**

1. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Narendra3002/next-auth-role-based-main.git
   cd next-auth-role-based-main
Install Dependencies:

Install the required dependencies using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following configurations:

env
Copy code
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
Running the Project
To run the development server, use:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Available Scripts
npm run dev: Start the development server.
npm run build: Build the application for production.
npm start: Start the production server.
How the System Works
User Registration: Users can register by providing their username, email, and password. Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.
Login: Users can log in with their email and password. Upon successful login, a JWT token is generated and returned to the client for session management.
Authorization: The JWT token is included in the request header to authenticate and authorize users. Access to certain routes is restricted based on the user’s role (Admin, User, Moderator).
RBAC System: The roles are predefined in the database. Only users with the correct roles have access to specific endpoints.
Technologies Used
Node.js and Express.js: Backend framework.
MongoDB: Database for storing user and role information.
JWT: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
bcrypt.js: Password hashing.
dotenv: Environment variable management.
